  {
    "instruction (string)": "cycle",
    "output (string)": "The menstrual cycle consists of four main phases: the follicular phase, ovulation, the luteal phase, and menstruation. During the follicular phase, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates follicles in the ovary to mature. Ovulation occurs when a mature egg is released from the ovary. The luteal phase follows ovulation, during which the ruptured follicle forms the corpus luteum and secretes progesterone. If fertilization does not occur, the uterine lining sheds during menstruation, marking the end of the cycle."

Incorporate foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids like salmon and flaxseeds to help alleviate menstrual cramps. During ovulation, emphasize foods high in antioxidants like berries and vegetables to support egg health. In the luteal phase, include calcium-rich foods like dairy and leafy greens to ease premenstrual symptoms. Stay hydrated and limit caffeine and processed foods throughout the cycle for overall health."

    "instruction (string)": "cycle",
    "output (string)": "The ideal exercise varies across the phases of the menstrual cycle. During the follicular phase (days 1-14), low to moderate intensity aerobic exercises like walking, cycling, and swimming are beneficial as estrogen levels rise, enhancing energy levels and endurance. In the ovulatory phase (around day 14), high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or strength training can be effective, capitalizing on peak energy and strength levels. In the luteal phase (days 15-28), focusing on yoga, Pilates, and lower-intensity workouts helps manage premenstrual symptoms and stress, while supporting the body's natural hormonal shifts. Listening to the body's cues and adjusting intensity accordingly is key throughout the cycle."
